[font=heading-1]Goal of the game[/font]
- Build or join a town and survive as long as you can
- Raid other towns. Defend your town. Reach 100 score on the leaderboard.

[font=heading-1]Town members and alliances[/font]
- To invite another player to your town, drop a coin on that player (with the Z key). To accept an invite, they also need to drop a coin on you.
- To leave a town, drop coal on the market. Note that their turrets will target you immediately.
- To form any alliance with another town, drop a coin on a town member. If they agree they need to drop a coin on you too.

[font=heading-1]PvP Shields[/font]
- PvP shields prevent players from entering, building and damaging
- Offline PvP shields deploy automatically once all players of a town leave the game
    - The size is same as your initial town wall, marked by the blue tiles
    - This only gets deployed if there are no enemies in your town's range - it is only safe to log out if the market shows no enemies
- Your town has a AFK PvP shield that you can use to safely take a quick break - deploy it from the market
- Big and behemoth biters can't penetrate your shield, but small and medium ones can

[font=heading-1]Advanced tips and tricks[/font]
- To join our discord, open wasteland-discord.fun in your web browser
- It's best to found new towns far from existing towns, as enemies will become aggressive with town's research.
    Biters and spitters become more aggressive towards towns that are advanced in research.
    Their evolution will scale around technology progress in any nearby towns and pollution levels.
- Need more ores? Hand mine a few big rocks to find ore patches under them!
- Need more oil? Kill biter worms - some of them will leave you an oil patch
- The town market is the heart of your town. If it is destroyed, you lose everything.
    So protect it well, repair it whenever possible, and increase its health by purchasing upgrades.
- It's possible to automate trading with the town center! How cool is that?!! Try it out.
    Tip: use filter inserters with to get coins/iron/.. out of the market
- Fishes procreate near towns. The more fishes, the quicker they multiply. Automated fish farm, anyone?
    Accidentally overfished? No problem, you can drop them back in
- Use /rename-town NEWNAME (chat command) to rename your town
- If you get stuck or trapped, use the /suicide chat command to respawn
- It is not possible to build near enemy turrets or power poles
    except logistics entities (inserters, belts, boxes, rails) that can be used to steal items
- Research modifier: Towns with more members (online+recently offline) have more expensive research. Less advanced towns have cheaper research
- Damage modifier: Members of towns with more online members cause reduced damage against other towns and players
- Biter waves with boss units (the ones with health bar) will attack more advanced towns while their member players are online]]
